This project aims to clone an Unsplash site with basic features, such as

- Display photos by collection
- Display search results by keyword
- Displays a preview photo in the modal.
- Filter image by color, orientation, relevancies, etc.

Some of the techniques that I applied in this project include

- SWR (Stale While Revalidate)
- [Blurhash](https://blurha.sh/) compact representation of a placeholder for an image
- Image lazy load
- Zustand for global state manager
